## Explanation of the project

The goal of this project was to create an immersive experience for Baccha Week at the Bordeaux Museum of Fine Arts.

To do so, we created a **"point and click" escape game** with a lot of script and **sound design** work. The experience is very pleasant to live and the game doesn't take more than 15 minutes!

## Initial situation

After a violent and mysterious storm, the works of art of the Bordeaux Museum of Fine Arts have strangely come to life in our reality. CÃ©sar, an old crab from a still life, seeks to find his natural habitat: the sea bed. Our sidekick will have to face his destiny and face the different enigmas while traveling from work to work that will allow him to advance if you help him to solve them! An online escape game that offers a cultural and artistic experience around a dark and immersive universe in the ocean depths.
